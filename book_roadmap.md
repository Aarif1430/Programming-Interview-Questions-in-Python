## This is a list of recommended software related books. 

I will attempt to update this list as I also move forward in my career. Take this as a good rough guide to some very good books. I perfer to read books that are less dry than your average textbook.

### The Basics
Data structures and algothrims are the bread and butter of creating good code, so are good design and clean structure.

### Linux
Linux is a very powerful operating system and its the most common OS used in the software industry. Thats because its the most customizable, flexible OS there is. Maintained by many contributors, very few bugs/crash, high uptime (no need to restart after updates), and less prone to viruses due to permissions. Its important to learn how to develop around linux as you will stumble upon some flavor of linux during your software career. Best to learn it early.

### Architecture Design
Once you get a few months of being a programmer, its important to learn how to architect your code. This will allow you to merge what you know about design patterns into code that is scalable and maintainable throughout the years to come.
- Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software
- Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design

### Life Skills
Life skills is rather important, as software engineers tend to solo themselves rather than work together with the team. As you age, you will find that you can't finish the project alone and you have to leverage your teammates at some point to get the job done. How you communicate with your peers is just as important as how you code. You have to work with people in this world, there is no avoiding it.
