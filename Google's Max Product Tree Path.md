# QUESTION
Given an unsorted binary tree of numbers. Find the maximum product you can have with one continous path in the tree.
For example:

```
        4
      /   \
     1     2
    / \   / \
   3   5 8   2
```
The result would be the product of [5,1,4,2,8] which is 240.

Similarly:
```
        4
      /   \
     0     2
    / \   / \
   3   5 8   2
```
Then the result would be [4,2,8] which is 64.
