There are multiple ways to solve this problem. Some will be more complicated than others. 
I believe this is a very simple and intuitive approach. 
Notice that the question wants the answer in a format that is the top row + middle rows + bottom row. 
We focus on how a zig zag is really made. The pattern that it creates is by going up then down repeatedly.
With that in mind, we can implement that idea in many different ways.
A very simple solution that doesn't require so much thinking is by using a queue and going up and down the queues and pushing elements into them.
Each queue will represent a row. At the end, concat them together to form the string.

```
class Solution(object):
    def convert(self, s, numRows):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type numRows: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if s == None:
            return ""
        elif numRows == 0 or numRows == 1:
            return s
        n_queues = [[] for _ in range(numRows)]
        curr_row = 0
        go_down = True
        for element in s:
            n_queues[curr_row].append(element)
            if curr_row == 0:
                go_down = True
            elif curr_row == numRows-1:
                go_down = False
            if go_down:
                curr_row += 1
            else:
                curr_row -= 1
        result = ""
        for row in n_queues:
            result += "".join(row)
        return result
```
