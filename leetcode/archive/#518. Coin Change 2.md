# EXPLAINATION
This is a type of knapsack problem. Obviously, we can use recursion to solve this, however, the run-time would be expoential. 
We can use dynamic programming to help us here. We can start by using a 2d array. The rows are each coin, the columns will represent 0 to amount. 

The idea is to calculate starting from amount 0, 1, 2... etc. 
For each coin, what it's total combinations are while using previously calculated combinations. The previous row/coins, will represent previous combinations that do not include your coin. While your current row/coin, can be used to calculate previous combinations that used your coin.

# SOLUTION
```
class Solution(object):
    def change(self, amount, coins):
        """
        :type amount: int
        :type coins: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if amount == 0:
            return 1
        # columns are amounts from 0 to amount, rows are the coins
        # we will buffer the dp array with an extra row and column,
        # so we can avoid too many out of bounds checking
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(amount+1)] for _ in range(len(coins)+1)]
        for row_index in range(1, len(dp)):
            for col_index in range(1, len(dp[0])):
                curr_coin = coins[row_index-1]
                curr_amount = col_index
                # your coin exactly matches the curr_amount
                if curr_coin == curr_amount:
                    dp[row_index][col_index] += 1
                # add the previously calculated curr_amount - curr_coin amounts
                # for example: if calculating coin 2 at amount 4
                # we want to go to the result of coin 2 when the amount=2 because 2+2 = 4
                previous_amount_index = curr_amount - curr_coin
                if previous_amount_index >= 0:
                    dp[row_index][col_index] += dp[row_index][previous_amount_index]
                # add the previously calculated amounts, in this case, the one above this index
                dp[row_index][col_index] += dp[row_index-1][col_index]
        return dp[-1][-1]

 # VARIANT (True Knapsack problem):
 Write a similar function to the question but this time, return a combination of coins that is the closest to the amount but does not exceed the amount. 
 The sum of coins does not have to exactly match the amount.
