To tackle this problem, one must reread the question and re-think how a palidrone is formed in relationship to calculating the longest subsequence.
For example, say you have a word 'aabaca'. The answer to this is 'aabaa'.
Try to apply divide and conquer to this question. 

You can think of this as 3 parts, a start character, middle sequence, and an end character. 
The only time a word can become the next largest palidrone subsequence is when the start and end characters equal. 
At that point you just need to add the middle sequence's longest palidrone subsequence + 2.
This is a perfect solution to use dynamic programming.
We can start by comparing words of length 2 then 3 then 4, etc... till max length.
We can intialize our dp to 1 and skip comparing words of length 1.
As we work our way up, we can use the dp to find what our middle sequence was and only evaluate whether it's a possible palidrone.
If its not a possible palidrone, then we can take the max of two previous subsequences and continue on to the next word.

        dp = [[1]*size for _ in xrange(size)]
        for length in xrange(1, size): # skip single character words
            for start_index in xrange(0, size-length):
                end_index = start_index + length
                if s[start_index] == s[end_index]:

                    if length != 1:
                        # for example, if we found 'aba', we got here because it started and ended with 'a'
                        # then we want the middle sequence, which is 'b'
                        # add the middle sequence's longest result from dp to calculation
                        dp[start_index][end_index] = 2 + dp[start_index+1][end_index-1]
                    else :
                        dp[start_index][end_index] = 2
                else:
                    # not a potential palidrone that can increase the result, like 'abbc'
                    # so just get the longest one found so far, like 'abb' or 'bbc' which is 2
                    dp[start_index][end_index] = max(dp[start_index][end_index-1], 
                                                     dp[start_index+1][end_index])
