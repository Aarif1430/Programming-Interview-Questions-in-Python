# EXPLAINATION
This is a hard problem, no doubt about it. It is more important you understand how to break down the problem. 
There is a recursion solution, it maybe simplier for some, but the runtime is exponential. Then there is a dynamic programming solution which would be NxM where N is the length of the string and M is the length of the pattern.

# EDGE CASE CONSIDERATIONS
```
cabc
c*c?
```

```
'' -> empty string
*
```
How about a pattern of '*****' with an empty string?

# SOLUTION DP
For this solution, dynamic programming was used. You should notice that a 1d array is not useful here so a 2d array should be used. For mine, I decided to use the cols as the string and the rows as the pattern. It will work either side you place them. However, for a 2d array, you must understand WHY and WHAT each cell top, left and top left true represent in relationship to any cell in the 2d array. I suggest drawing a 2d array like I have above and going thru this on your own.

Here is a breakdown:
- Top-Left: This means, the previous pattern char and previous string char.
- Top: This means, the previous pattern char and INCLUDING the current string char.
- Left: This means, INCLUDING the current pattern char and previous string char.

Really step thru the example of 'cabc' as the string and 'c*c?' as the pattern. This is a great example to understand WHY and WHAT it means when you come across a each different pattern character and what each pattern charracter really cares about. When tackling dp problems, really ask yourself these questions. For this particular cell, does it care about the top-left, top, or left cell? What is the relationship between those three cells and mine? How can I use the previous answer from these cells to figure out the answer for this particular cell?

```
   '' c a b c
''  T F F F F
c   F T F F F
*   F T T T T
c   F F F F T
?   F F F F F
```
