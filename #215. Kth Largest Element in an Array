This question maybe too obvious for some, why don't I just use a sorting algothrim and be done with it?
Yes you are correct, you can just sort it and have a working solution. However, this question really is testing your ability to understand sorting algothrims on the next level.
An interview will most likely ask you the tough question of "Can we do better?". 
Look at it this way, in the perspective of the question, we really don't care about the elements before K or after, just the Kth element only.
That is why selecting any sorting algothrim, even something like quicksort will not be the best solution. All sorting algothrims are sorting everything, while this question just wants 1 of the elements to be sorted.
This is why a partial sorting algothrim is the choice.
