# EXPLAINATION
This is a type of knapsack problem. Obviously, we can use recursion to solve this, however, the run-time would be expoential. 
We can use dynamic programming to help us here. We can start by using a 2d array. The rows are each coin, the columns will represent 0 to amount. 

The idea is to calculate starting from amount 0, 1, 2... etc. 
For each coin, what it's total combinations are while using previously calculated combinations. The previous row, will represent previous combinations that does not include your coin. While your current row/coin, can be used to calculate previous combinations that used your coin.

# SOLUTION
```
class Solution(object):
    def change(self, amount, coins):
        """
        :type amount: int
        :type coins: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if amount == 0:
            return 1
        # columns are amounts from 0 to amount, rows are the coins
        # we will buffer the dp array with an extra row and column,
        # so we can avoid too many out of bounds checking
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(amount+1)] for _ in range(len(coins)+1)]
        for row_index in range(1, len(dp)):
            for col_index in range(1, len(dp[0])):
                curr_coin = coins[row_index-1]
                curr_amount = col_index
                # your coin exactly matches the curr_amount
                if curr_coin == curr_amount:
                    dp[row_index][col_index] += 1
                # add the previously calculated curr_amount - curr_coin amounts
                # for example: if calculating coin 2 at amount 4
                # we want to go to the result of coin 2 when the amount=2 because 2+2 = 4
                previous_amount_index = curr_amount - curr_coin
                if previous_amount_index >= 0:
                    dp[row_index][col_index] += dp[row_index][previous_amount_index]
                # add the previously calculated amounts, in this case, the one above this index
                dp[row_index][col_index] += dp[row_index-1][col_index]
        return dp[-1][-1]
 ```
 
 # VARIANT (True Knapsack problem):
 Write a similar function to the question but this time, return a combination of coins that is the closest to the amount but does not exceed the amount. 
 The sum of coins does not have to exactly match the amount.
