I'll be using this to fill in some content that was not covered enough.
Other than that, this will be just a reference for other material that will better explain system design than I can.

I would recommend starting with Grokking the System Design Interview eCourse.
Worth the money and will fill in a lot of the gaps for a beginner to system design.
Use the YouTube channels as supplement and Google's SRE eBook for context to some real life scenario debugging.

## Start Here
- [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512)
- https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer

## YouTube suggestions
I recommend checking this guy's channel (Success in Tech). I would actually avoid Tushar Roy's channel, the quality of system design isn't on par. Another possible channel is Gaurav Sen.
