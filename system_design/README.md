I'll be using this section to fill in some content that may have not been covered enough.
Other than that, this will be just a reference for other material that will better explain system design than I can.

I would recommend starting with Grokking the System Design Interview eCourse.
Worth the money and will fill in a lot of the gaps for a beginner to system design.
Use the YouTube channels as supplement and Google's SRE eBook for context to some real life scenario debugging.
I highly recommend picking up "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" book, really good read and to the point.

## Start Here
- [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512)
- https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer

## YouTube suggestions
I recommend checking out "Success in Tech" and "Gaurav Sen" on YouTube.
I would avoid Tushar Roy's YouTube channel, the quality of system design isn't on par, his channel is only good for DS & Algos.
