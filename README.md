# Leetcode-Solutions
After doing over 120+ questions from EPI, CTCI and leetcode combined, I've hand selected questions I believe every software engineer needs to complete in preparation for the Big N whiteboarding interviews. These are questions, I believe will give the most bang for your buck and investment on time. Worthy of adding to your arsenal to fight the coding gods! 

Each question has its own unique 'gotcha' that you should learn. You want to take each question to the most optimal solution in-order to fully maximize what you can learn from it. Some questions are onion questions, with multiple solutions to the problem, its also important to know them all. For example, do it both recursive and iteratively or BFS and DFS.

### How you structure your code
#### These question are fairly straight forward, no trick questions or gotchas here. You should try to improve and shave the excess fat off your code when trying to solve this. If an interviewer asks you one of these questions, it is to test your ability to write 'clean' code, not how you utalize DS or Algos.
- #36. Valid Sudoku
- #289. Game of Life

### How you think
#### These questions can be diffcult if you use the wrong data structure or set of logic, but is quite easy once you focus on 'how' the solution is built. Try to use a simple test case but focus purely on the lowest denominator solution. What's makes a trapped rain water? Or what makes a zig zag a zig zag?
- #42. Trapping Rain Water
- #6. ZigZag Conversion
