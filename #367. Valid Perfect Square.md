This solution will run at O(log(n)). We use divide and conquer and some concepts from quick sort partitioning to solve this problem the most efficent way.
Once your number gets pass 4, if we begin our search at half of the number given, the perfect square will always be under half of the number.
for each iteration of the search, reduce our search space by half. You can think of low and high as our starting and end search space. 
We calculate our product using the middle number from the range between low and high. Based on the product, we can determine if the solution is above or below the middle value or just right.

```
class Solution(object):
    def isPerfectSquare(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if num < 1:
            return False
        elif num == 1 or num == 4:
            return True
        low = 2
        high = num/2 #cut down on calculations, won't work with num = 4
        while (low < high):
            middle = low + ((high-low)/2)
            product = middle * middle
            if product == num:
                return True
            elif product > num:
                high = middle
            else:
                low = middle+1
        return False
```
